								<h3>The winners</h3>
                                <p>It has been a wild month, many things happening; but here we are, now that this month has concluded, we ran a vote to choose everyone's favourite photographs that were submitted to this collective; in this short post we will show the most voted photographs.</p>
                                <h2>Team Blue</h2>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/win1b.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Most voted image - by member Canadian Fruit Basket</h3>
                                <p>Taking first place of most voted photograph with 5 out of 5 votes, is this piece, taken by our member Canadian Fruit Basket.</p>
                                <em>> What emotion do you think your photograph conveys?</em>
                                <blockquote>Sense of danger and calm at the same time, sort of like the waterfall scene from Bird Box.</blockquote>

                                <em>> What emotion do you think this photograph conveys?</em>
                                <blockquote>It gives me a sense of calmness, it makes me feel happiness, it reminds me of other places I've visited, it makes me appreciate nature and take care of it.</blockquote>

                                <blockquote>Probably a tranquility of nature regaining what it once had. Im honestly unsure cause I don't think about the emotions most of the time</blockquote>
